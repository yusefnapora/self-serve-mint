# ðŸŒ¿ Self Serve Mint

This project is a simple NFT minting web app that allows anyone to mint an [ERC-721][erc-721] NFT on Ethereum mainnet, or a selection of test networks.

Self Serve Mint was created as a demonstration of the NFT minting process to go along with a workshop for South by Southwest 2022. It's based on [scaffold-eth][scaffold-eth], an excellent full-stack boilerplate for creating Ethereum dApps.
